title: Hi, I am Nilanjan
---

I am a Student pursuing Computer Science at [**BITS Pilani, India**](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in). I love solving problems with C++ and Javascript. View my Codeforces Profile [here](https://codeforces.com/profile/loser_NIL). Currently I am solving Problems using basic data structure like arrays, linked list, strings and using some simple high school mathematics only. I will publish all algorithms by which I solved this Problem. If anyone found a better approach to solve the Problem kindly discuss on **Discussion Forum** or Contribute to github as described on [**Contribute**](https://nil1729.github.io/codeforces001/contribute/) Page.
